# *MSDF text rendering* - showcase

> ⚠️ This showcase is still being developed so you may not find some of the listed *features*. ⚠️

***MSDF-showcase*** is a showcase of *glsl shaders* utilizing **MSDF (multi-channel signed distance fields)** to render text in high quality while being *magnified*, *minified* or *rotated* in 3D space. It shows the basic usage of MSDF in text rendering with some additional, more advanced text modifiers.

All assets and characters are generated by the [msdfgen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen) utility. Options to create the character assets were MTSDF (multi-channel *true* signed distance field) type with distance field pixel range of 6.

For *2D rendering*, you are better off using a rasterizer since there are no constant text size or rotation modifications, unlike in 3D rendering.

## Shader output in *real-time*

To see how the shaders work in real-time, you can download the [**SHADERed**](https://github.com/dfranx/SHADERed/releases) desktop application, open the ***'.sprj'*** file from the repo with the *SHADERed app* and see the output on the canvas. Learn more about *SHADERed* on their official [Tutorial website](https://shadered.org/docs/tutorials.html) or by watching [Youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK0EO-cKorzRAEfwHoJFiIldiyiyDR3-2).

## Basic MSDF usage

The next snippet shows the basic usage of a MSDF texture (*distance field pixel range 4*) to render text. For more info check out this [explanation](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen#using-a-multi-channel-distance-field) from the msdfgen creator.

```glsl
uniform sampler2D tex;

in vec2 uvCoord;
out vec4 outColor;

float median(float r, float g, float b) {
    return max(min(r, g), min(max(r, g), b));
}

float screenPxRange() {
    vec2 unitRange = vec2(4.0)/vec2(textureSize(tex, 0));
    vec2 screenTexSize = vec2(1.0)/fwidth(uvCoord);
    return max(0.5*dot(unitRange, screenTexSize), 1.0);
}

void main() {
    vec4 texel = texture(tex, uvCoord);
    float dist = median(texel.r, texel.g, texel.b);

    float pxDist = screenPxRange() * (dist - 0.5);
    float opacity = clamp(pxDist + 0.5, 0.0, 1.0);

    outColor = vec4(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, opacity);
}
```

## Features

In the shaders, you can find examples of:

- basic text rendering in 3D space with quality preservation while being *magnified*, *minified* or *rotated*,

- modifying text thickness,

- adding a colored outline with custom thickness to the text,

- applying softness to the body or the text outline,

- custom colored text drop shadow, 

- gamma correction
