# *MSDF text rendering* - showcase

> ⚠️ This showcase is still being developed so you may not find some of the listed *features*. ⚠️

   This is a showcase of *glsl shaders* utilizing **MSDF (multi-channel signed distance fields)** to render text in hight quality while being *magnified*, *minified* or *rotated* in 2D or 3D space. It shows basic usage of MSDF in text rendering with some additional, more advanced, text modifiers.

## *Real Time* Shader Testing

To see how the shaders work in real time you can download [**SHADERed**](https://github.com/dfranx/SHADERed/releases) desktop application, open the ***'.sprj'*** file from the repo with the *SHADERed app* and see the output on the canvas. Learn more about *SHADERed* on their official [Tutorial website](https://shadered.org/docs/tutorials.html) or by watching [Youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK0EO-cKorzRAEfwHoJFiIldiyiyDR3-2).

## Features

In the shaders you can find examples of:

- basic text rendering in 2D space,

- basic text rendering in 3D space with quality preservation while being *magnified*, *minified* or *rotated*,

- modifiying text thickness,

- adding a colored outline with custom thickness to text,

- applying softness to the body or the outline,

- custom colored text drop shadow, 

- gamma correction
