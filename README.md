# *MSDF text rendering* - showcase

> ⚠️ This showcase is still being developed so you may not find some of the listed *features*. ⚠️

***MSDF-showcase*** is a showcase of *glsl shaders* utilizing **MSDF (multi-channel signed distance fields)** to render text in high quality while being *magnified*, *minified* or *rotated* in 3D space. It shows the basic usage of MSDF in text rendering with some additional, more advanced text modifiers.

All assets and characters are generated by the [msdfgen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen) utility. Options to create the character assets were MTSDF (multi-channel *true* signed distance field) type with distance field pixel range of 6.

For *2D rendering*, you are better off using a rasterizer since there are no constant text size or rotation modifications, unlike in 3D rendering.

**Remember to not** generate every single character texture separately as in this showcase. Instead create a texture atlas with [msdf-atlas-gen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdf-atlas-gen) utility which also outputs a *arfont* file containing all character atlas positions, kerning info, space between characters, etc.

## Shader output in *real-time*

To see how the shaders work in real-time, you can download the [**SHADERed**](https://github.com/dfranx/SHADERed/releases) desktop application, open the ***'.sprj'*** file from the repo with the *SHADERed app* and see the output on the canvas. Learn more about *SHADERed* on their official [Tutorial website](https://shadered.org/docs/tutorials.html) or by watching [Youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK0EO-cKorzRAEfwHoJFiIldiyiyDR3-2).

## Basic MSDF usage

The next snippet shows the basic usage of a MSDF texture (*distance field pixel range 4*) to render text while preserving highest quality. For more info check out this [explanation](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen#using-a-multi-channel-distance-field) from the msdfgen creator.

```glsl
uniform sampler2D tex;

in vec2 uvCoord;
out vec4 outColor;

float median(float r, float g, float b) {
    return max(min(r, g), min(max(r, g), b));
}

float screenPxRange() {
    vec2 unitRange = vec2(4.0)/vec2(textureSize(tex, 0));
    vec2 screenTexSize = vec2(1.0)/fwidth(uvCoord);
    return max(0.5*dot(unitRange, screenTexSize), 1.0);
}

void main() {
    vec4 texel = texture(tex, uvCoord);
    float dist = median(texel.r, texel.g, texel.b);

    float pxDist = screenPxRange() * (dist - 0.5);
    float opacity = clamp(pxDist + 0.5, 0.0, 1.0);

    outColor = vec4(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, opacity);
}
```

## Content

In the shaders, you can find examples of:

- basic text rendering in 3D space with quality preservation while being *magnified*, *minified* or *rotated*,
- modifying text thickness,
- adding a colored outline with custom thickness to the text,
- applying softness to the body or the text outline,
- custom colored text drop shadow, 
- gamma correction

## MSDF tips

Here are a few useful tips regarding MSDFs:

- Do **not** use mipmaps. When text is minified mipmaps will break anti-aliasing.

- **Supersampling** helps with anitaliasing but reduces performance and FPS.

- **Thicker fonts** can help with quality preservation when the text is downscaled.

- **Gamma correction** also helps with quality preservation when the text is downscaled. 

- **Higher dimensions** per character (32x32 or more) are desirable when generating the MSDF texture. This helps reduce the artefacts created while rendering *more complex and thinner fonts*. These artefacts are caused by the lack of detail on MSDF textures.

- My preference when generating MSDF textures regarding the **distance field pixel range** is **setting it to 6**. However, putting it higher will make no difference and setting it too high will create strange artefacts when rendering.

- MSDF texture **magnify filter** (MagFilter) should be **set to linear** and not nearest, where in that case distance fields won't work.

### The repo motive

There are two reasons why I wanted to make this repo. The first reason is that I am very interested in distance fields and their usage in rendering. Therefore, this repo helps me to understand and learn more. The second reason is the very rare findings on this topic over the internet. While searching for code examples and usage information regarding the subject, I could only find a few articles. Also, searching on GitHub, I often found the same basic *code snippet* repeating itself in almost every repo. I want to fill this repo with as much information and code examples (basic to advanced) as possible so other people don't have to search aimlessly.
